With the namp scan we get only 3 ports open, 21 ( FTP running Pure-FTPd ), 22 ( SSH ) and 80 ( Web )

Looking into the port 80.
On the first scan we get that Zetta is a sharing service based on the FTP protocol. Searching more in depth of the web file we find a set of credentials that are generated randomly every time we reload the page. 
Run a gobuster process but nothing usefull comes up. 

Loging in the FTP service.
From the web script we get that each and every combination of 32 chars will working when trying to login into the ftp. So we run `ftp 10.10.10.156` and than pass `QAb2VYdiJb77F9HUThtNRemWkP6uaQkg` on the username and password fied. 
In the welcome message we figure out that `IPv6 connections are also welcome on this server.`. Let's try to switch to that since there is nothing interesting in there. 
To do this, we should use the `EPRT` command. Start a new raw session using `nc -v 10.10.10.156 21` and than authentificate with `USER` and `PASS` commands. Thank follow the sequence. Before using the `LIST` command stat `tcpdump -lni tun0 -vvvvvvv ip6`
Now we got the IPv6 adress. Let's nmap it

With the new IPv6 adress we need to use the `-6` tag on nmap, and on the full port scan we get a new port, 8730. This seems to be rsync, an app which syncs the files on UNIX systems.

Exploiting the RSYNC ( 8730 ) 
We first try with the telnet session and get a greeting message, but we can't do a thing here.
Trying the metasploit module called `auxiliary/scanner/rsync/modules_list` we get 9 modules `bin, boot, lib, lib64, opt, sbin, srv, usr, var`
Now we try to login into the rsync to extract some data from these modules, but when we fire up the `rsync -av6 rsync://[dead:beef::250:56ff:feb9:6611]:8730/etc data` and we get the whole directory. Let's go searching it.

Forensics on the recieved data
With the whole etc file synced on our machine, we get quite some information. First of all checking the rsyncd.conf we got that the username is `roy`  

Starting the bruteforce.
Now we need to get the roy's password. Because there is no script online that supports rsync cracking over ipv6 we need to make a custom one. I decided to do this by using the `pexpect` python library. The result of this can be found in `rsyncBruteforcePassword.py` 
Let's reuse the command in the script and download the roy's home directory. And we got the user flag. 
Trying to get a shell using rsync
Looking over into the config file we see that we have read/write access to the `home_roy` directory. Let's add our ssh keys to the `authorized_keys` on the machine. First we create new ones using `ssh-keygen -t rsa` 
Upload them to the remote host using rsync `rsync -a .ssh rsync://roy@[dead:beef::250:56ff:feb9:6611]:8730/home_roy` and set the permissions `rsync --rsync-path="chmod 700 authorized_keys" rsync://roy@[dead:beef::250:56ff:feb9:6611]:8730/home_roy/.ssh`
Now let's login `ssh -i zettaKeys roy@10.10.10.156` and we have a stable shell.

Enum the machine.
From the .tudo.xml we get that user has setup a service which syslog, which could either be syslog-ng or rsyslog. The `ps aux` is short, so we need to check it in another way. To do this, we can use the systemctl process. Checking both we get positive result on rsyslog, the cmd that I used being `systemctl status rsyslog`.
Now we aslo know that it has some integration with postgresql.  
In the `/etc/rsyslog.d` we got a git repository. Looking into the .git folder we got nothing. But when we try a `git show` to see the last changes we get a password and a user.
We should find a cmd that is implemented with `logger` 

Current IPv6 -> dead:beef::250:56ff:feb9:6611

Credentials:
-> roy:computer ( rsync only )

Flags:
-> USER: a575bdb345f2de0a3172c8282452be91
