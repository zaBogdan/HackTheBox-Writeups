We have only the smb port open. 

Let's try an anonymous login. `./smbclient root@10.10.10.178`
Under the "Data" share, on Shared/Templates/HR we have the 'Welcome Email.txt'. This file contains the Username and password for the authentificated SMB.


Unintended way (patched)
With the data, we try different smb exploits, and the psexec works! `./psexec.py TempUser:welcome2019@10.10.10.178`
We notice something that's odd, we are `nt authority\system`
The root flag is under Administrator. 
The user flag is `C:\Shares\Users\C.Smith`

Intended way.
Looking into `Data/Configs/NotepadPlusPlus/config.xml` at the bottom of the script we have this mention `<File filename="\\HTB-NEST\Secure$\IT\Carl\Temp.txt" />` which leads us to search more in depth this smb client. 
If we use the share Secure$ we find out that we can only list `\Secure$\IT\Carl`, there isn't any file called `Temp.txt`

Recon \IT\Carl over the Secure$ share & decrypt the password.
First of all, looking into all the directories, the only one that seems interesting is `VB Projects` under WIP directory we have the full source code of the RU-Scanner which we encounterd in out initial recon, under the `Data\IT\Configs\RU_Scanner` in there being a password leaked. 
Getting most of the files from the smb server we ended up looking into `Utils.vb` which seems to have the encryption and decryption algorithms. We will use a site to transform this into C# code and we will run it into a compiler and add the Main method to get the password decrypted. The final form of the file is into `decryptor.c#`. Now having the password we can relogin into SMBClient and get the user flag.

Heading to root.
In the SMB client we have two new things, `HqkLdap.exe` and `debugpassword`. The second file is all about windows alternate datastream and it must be directly downloaded on a windows box.
Now let's connect tot the hight port service (4386) and use `debug WBQ201953D8w` to get acess to everything. Looking into some directories under `setdir ../ldap` we can `showquerry 2` and get the encrypted administrator password. 
For this part we will need dnSpy to make things easier and the same website we used in the first part. I fast crafter the needed file ( found under admin.c# ). Now because we don't have acess to windows remote manager (WinRM) we will use psexec because we have access to all shares to write, `./psexec.py Administrator:XtH4nkS4Pl4y1nGX@10.10.10.178`.

Rooted intended.
