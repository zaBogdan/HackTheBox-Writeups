We have a website and one over SSL

Looking at the ssl certificate we get a new path "staging-order.mango.htb". Binding this to the box ip ( 10.10.10.162 ) we get a login page over http. 
Now let's try to check if we have a MangoDB, runing NoSQL
We can see on BURP that if we try with 'username[$ne]=toto&password[$ne]=toto&login=login' we get a 302 and the redirect gets us to a under construction page. 
From this one we got that one of the usernames is 'admin@mango.htb'
The password length of the admin should be 12.
Use the script from an0nlk page and you will find two users with their password
Login as mango, as this should be the user and you don't get any user.txt so this is not the user of the box :(
Let's try a su admin with the remaining password and we got the USER

Heading to root.
On the enum we get that a SUID vulnerable file is jjs
Found on gtfo bins that it works :) 
We have to 'echo "Java.type('java.lang.Runtime').getRuntime().exec('/bin/sh -pc \$@|sh\${IFS}-p _ echo /bin/bash -p <$(tty) >$(tty) 2>$(tty)').waitFor()" | /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/jjs'
And we got the root.
