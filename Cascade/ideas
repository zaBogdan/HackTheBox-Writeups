After the first nmap scan we have 445 (SMB), 139 (RPC) and 389 (LDAP) which are the most important.

Checking the smb (445)
It seems we have anonymous login allowed but nothing available in there really.

Checking LDAP (389)
Here we will use JXplorer to check. The anonymous login in here gives us more intel than smb actually. Now we mount cascade and search into UK/Users for some interesting stuff. At first we see that we have a hand of users.
Under `Ryan Thompson` it's a filed called `cascadeLegacyPwd` with a base64 encoded password. Also, from the email address we can get the naming schema. So now we have the first set of credentials.

Looking into the SMB with the new credentials (445)
Being authentificated it seems that we have a few shares, the only one that's interesting being `Data`. Searching into it using smbmap we have an interesting file located at `Data\IT\Temp\s.smith\` called `VNC Install.reg`. Locally it can be found in `smb` folder.

Decrypting the VNC password and getting the user.
In this file we have an encrypted password, in hex. On a brief google search we get a windows tool that decrypts this password. Switch fast to the windows box and using `vncpwd.exe 6bcf2a4b6e5aca0f` we get `sT333ve2`. Being located under s.smith in the smb I guess it's hist password. So let's try to login `evil-winrm -u s.smith -p sT333ve2 -i 10.10.10.182` and we get the user flag.

Back to the SMB to get new files, this time as s.smith
I looked into the machine, but there was nothing usefull so I rechecked the smb, maybe this this I get access to new shares. And I actually did. The "Audit$" share was available now. In here there are only 3 interesting files, `CascAudit.exe` `CascCrypto.dll` and `DB\Audit.db`. Downloading them it seems that we need to decrypt a new password found in Audit.db, being for ArkSvc. Using `strings Audit.db|less` we find somewhere  `ArkSvcBQO5l5Kj9MdErXx6Q6AGOw==` and we need only the base64 encoded. For this we will switch over to windows again using dnSpy.
We will import both `.exe` and `.dll` to get the right stuff. At first, looking in `CascAudit.exe` we see a call in the `Main` function a call to `Crypto.DecryptString(encryptedString, "c4scadek3y654321");`. Looking now in the `CascCrypto.dll` we see the `DecryptString` function that take two arguments, a base64 encrypted string and a key. Also the instantiation of the AES class it suggests the encryption algorithm. Here we have the IV key `1tdyjCbY1Ix49842`. Having all three pieces we can decrypt the password and get ArkSvc. 

Working with the knew knowledge to get NT\Authority.
We can login back into the box with the new set of credentials `evil-winrm -u arksvc -p w3lc0meFr31nd -i 10.10.10.182` and we actually see in `whoami /all` that we are part of `CASCADE\AD Recycle Bin` group. Googleing about this we actually get an article about this group that seems interesting. Here we find a cmd that we can run in the powershell `Get-ADObject -filter 'isdeleted -eq $true -and name -ne "Deleted Objects"' -includeDeletedObjects -property *`. Here we have again another `cascadeLegacyPwd` of the TempAdmin. But this was deleted after the meeting in 2018. So I guess we it's worth a shot to try the administrator.

Get the root with `evil-winrm -u Administrator -p baCT3r1aN00dles -i 10.10.10.182`

The administrator hash can be found in `secretsdump` file.
