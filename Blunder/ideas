After an initial scan we have only 2 ports open: 22(ssh) and 80(web)

Recon the web and find a lead (port 80)

The only thing that we can actualy get out of this box is on the web. So I've started a recon in the background while I was looking on the site `gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt -u http://10.10.10.191/ -x .php,.txt,.hml -t 40`
It seems that we have to deal with a cms. After some time of running the recon I also get a hit on `/admin`. It's `BLUDIT`. 
Running a searchploit against it seems we it has an Authentificated RCE, with a metasploit module available. 
Now, we don't have a username or a password. But, the file `todo.txt` does point us to a `fergus` user. So we might try to bruteforce it.

Bruteforcing the password and getting the foothold.
After a lot of enum, I ended up at one conclusion: it's bruteforce the box. With that said, i searched for a script that can bruteforce this CMS, and I got a hit on github. I've actually needed to modify it a little and read form a wordlist.
Let's give it a try with rockyou. After sometime, I saw that it useless, so I decided to go back to the site and grab a new wordlist. For this I've used cewl, as shown: `cewl http://10.10.10.191/ -w wordlist.txt`
Now, after a few minutes, I got my first set of credentials: `fergus:RolandDeschain`
I've started metasploit and used `linux/http/bludit_upload_images_exec`. Now I have a shell as www-data. 

Privesc from www-data to hugo.
Here I need to start a privesc and I will take into account that there is a new blog, `bludit-3.10.0a`. From the `/bl-content/databases/users.php` I got the second hash which cracked is `Password120`. 
In orded to get a privesc we need tty shell, so I will upgrade to python shell. Now I just `su Hugo` and we have the user. 

Pwn the box.
Well, the root part is easy because sudo is vulnerable (as shown in the article below). THe only thing we need to do is `sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash`.

Rooted.
