After both, small and big, nmap scans we got only two ports open, 22 (SSH) and 80 (WEB)

Looking over the 80 port.
First thing that comes up is the "Sign Up" button. Looking into the html code we get a script that says `Please fill name field. Should not be more than 10 characters`, so we should be trying a SQL Truncated attack. 
Crafting the payload we get that the admin's email is `admin@book.htb` and we will guess the user being admin. The full burp request is in the file `signupadmin.request`
Now that we have a new admin user with the same credentials, but a new password, we can login into the `/admin` and try other exploits.

Being an admin user on the 80 port.
Now looking into what we should exploit we get that into `collections.php` could be a LFI with that pdf reading the content of the files. 
So now we should craft a payload to get all the users ( user.sequence part 1 ), than read the user.txt flag ( part 2 ) and than get the id_rsa ( part 3 )

Now we got the user. ( ssh -i reader_rsa reader@10.10.10.176 )  

Heading to the root
After some enumeration, we got on pspy an interesting thing, `/usr/sbin/logrotate -f /root/log.cfg` and when we google this we get a priv esc method. So let's try to apply on our current machine. 
Well, now we should upload the `logrotten.c` on the box, compile it using `gcc -o logrotten logrotten.c` and than run it with `./logrotten -p ./payloadfile /home/reader/backups/access.log`. [ The payload file can be found in this directory ]
Because this is based on logs, we should simulate a change into the looging system using `echo "zaBogdan_wh0am1" > /home/reader/backups/access.log`
Now let's fast cat the `.ssh/id_rsa` and login into the root ssh. 

Pwned the box. ( ssh -i root_rsa root@10.10.10.176 )
